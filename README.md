## A STIX 2.1 Extension for Sharing Security Playbooks Through the Course of Action SDO

### Properties that Comprise the Nested Property Extension of COA SDO to Support Sharing Machine-Readable Security Playbooks:
| Property Name | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |:--- |
| **type** (required)| `string` | The value of this property **MUST** be `playbook`. |
| **extension_type** (required) | `string` | The value of this property **MUST** be `property-extension`. |
| **playbook_id** (required)| `string` | A value that (uniquely) identifies the playbook. If the playbook itself embeds an identifier then the `playbook_id` **SHOULD** use the same identifier (value). If not, the producer needs to generate a UUIDv4 for the playbook. |
| **created** (required)| `timestamp` | The time at which the extension (sub-component instance) was created. This may be different from the time at which the "parent" COA object instance was created. |
| **modified** (required)| `timestamp` | The time that this particular version of the extension (sub-component instance) was last modified. |
| **revoked** (optional)| `boolean` | A boolean that identifies if the extension (sub-component instance) is no longer valid. |
| **creator** (required)| `identifier` | The identifier of the entity that created this playbook. |
| **valid_from** (optional)| `timestamp` | The time from which the playbook is considered valid and the steps that it contains can be executed. |
| **valid_until** (optional)| `timestamp` | The time at which this playbook should no longer be considered a valid playbook to be executed. |
| **description** (optional)| `string` | An explanation, details, and more context about what this playbook does and tries to accomplish. |
| **labels** (optional)| `list` of type `string` | A set of labels for the playbook. |
| **impact** (optional)| `integer` | From 0 to 100, an integer representing the impact the playbook has on the organization. A value of 0 means specifically undefined. Values range from 1, the lowest impact, to a value of 100, the highest. For example, a purely investigative playbook that is non-invasive would have a low impact value of 1. In contrast, a playbook that performs changes such as adding rules into a firewall would have a higher impact value. |
| **severity** (optional)| `integer` | From 0 to 100, an integer representing the seriousness of the conditions that this playbook addresses. A value of 0 means specifically undefined. Values range from 1, the lowest severity, to a value of 100, the highest. |
| **priority** (optional)| `integer` | From 0 to 100, an integer representing the priority of this playbook relative to other defined playbooks. A value of 0 means specifically undefined. Values range from 1, the highest priority, to a value of 100, the lowest. |
| **organization_type** (optional)| `list` of type `open-vocab` | The type of organization that the playbook is intended for. The value for this property **SHOULD** come from the `industry-sector-ov` open vocabulary.|
| **playbook_type** (optional)| `list` of type `open-vocab` | The security-related functions the playbook addresses. A playbook may account for multiple types (e.g., detection and investigation). Open Vocabulary: `[notification, detection, investigation, prevention, mitigation, remediation,attack]`. |
| **playbook_standard** (required)| `string` | The standard/format/nota tion the playbook conforms to (e.g., CACAO). |
| **playbook_abstraction** (optional)| `open-vocab` | The playbookâ€™s level of abstraction. Open Vocabulary: `[template, executable]`. |
| **playbook** (optional)| `string` | The entire playbook in its native format (e.g., CACAO JSON). Security playbook producers and consumers use this property to share and retrieve playbooks. |
| **playbook_base64** (optional)| `binary` | The entire playbook encoded in base64. Security playbook producers and consumers of playbooks use this property to share and retrieve playbooks.
